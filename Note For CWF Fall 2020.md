# Note For CWF Fall 2020:
This App started development during CWF: Fall 2020 (https://codewithfriends.io/) and as requested here I'm gonna talk a little about how was it.

For the event I decided to work on a uni assignment I had during this October. For the assignment we had to build and app that consumes data from a third party api and we would have to use JavaScript with some, as the description says, "modern technology" aka Vue, Angular, React and stuff.

So I decided to go with React cause I had some prior experience with it. So I built Spotify Stats and it basically shows (or will show, I need to keep working on it) your statistics on Spotify. Right now it can only show your top artists and top tracks. As I as pretty new to React I basically learned the basics of it, I Hope. So how to set up the project, how to make a request for an api, how to use the library for the Spotify API and how to work with components was basically what I've learned this month.

Overall it was really fun to work on the project and I'm very happy with it.

Last but not least I want to say thanks to @Rian.js and @WilliamT on discord for the help with env variables.
